# Project summary
 Making the right stock choices is a challenge for all market operators, especially with the
 vast number of stocks to consider and the constant changes in the market. Operators of
ten have different goals and risk preferences, and sorting through all available options to
 find the right fit can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Without an efficient way to cate
gorize and assess stocks, operators risk making decisions that donâ€™t align with their objectives.
 
 To address this challenge, a model was developed using historical data from the S&P 500 to
 group stocks based on their risk and return characteristics. The goal was to create a simple,
 flexible framework that helps operators quickly identify stocks that match different investor
 profiles.
 
 Three groups in the index were stocks with high return and moderate volatility, suitable
 for aggressive profile investors, stocks with low return and high volatility, and stocks with
 moderate return and low volatility, recommended for conservative profile investors.
 The model classifies stocks into distinct categories based on their risk levels and return po
tential, making it easier for operators to match stocks with the right profiles. To ensure
 consistency and reliability, the model follows a clear, structured approach to evaluating and
 classifying stocks.
 
 The model has also been tested on stocks from the NASDAQ 100, demonstrating that it can
 be applied across different markets. It is recommended for investors with conservative profile
 to invest in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and AstraZeneca, meanwhile, aggressive profile
 investors are recommended to invest in Arm Holdings.
 
 By simplifying the stock selection process, the model saves time and enables more informed
 decisions. It ensures that stock choices align with client goals while offering flexibility to adapt
 to changing market conditions. This approach helps better meet the diverse needs of clients
 and improves the overall efficiency of investment strategies.
